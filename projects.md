### [HvShield](https://github.com/Youssix/HvShield) - Hypervisor-Based Memory Integrity Monitor

A thin Intel VT-x hypervisor that uses EPT (Extended Page Tables) to enforce kernel code integrity at the hardware level.

The hypervisor sits below the OS and monitors write access to critical kernel memory regions. Any attempt to modify protected pages (code sections, SSDT, IDT) triggers an EPT violation that gets logged and optionally blocked before it reaches the OS.

Built from scratch in C, no framework dependencies. Handles VMCS lifecycle, EPT construction with 2MB large pages, MTRR-aware memory typing, and multi-core VMLAUNCH/VMRESUME scheduling.

**What it detects:**
- Kernel code patching (rootkit installation)
- SSDT hooking
- IDT modification
- Unauthorized driver code modification

**Stack:** C, Intel VT-x, EPT, Windows kernel
**Writeup:** [VMCS by Practice](/2026/05/20/vmcs-by-practice/), [EPT Internals](/2026/05/18/ept-internals/)

### [CRTScan](https://github.com/Youssix/CRTScan) - DLL Injection Detection via CRT Fingerprinting

A detection tool that identifies injected DLLs by analyzing C Runtime artifacts. Based on the observation that `__security_init_cookie` calls 4 hookable API functions during initialization, and the return addresses from those calls reveal the calling module.

Hooks `GetSystemTimeAsFileTime`, `QueryPerformanceCounter`, `GetCurrentProcessId`, and `GetCurrentThreadId`. When any of these fire, it walks the call stack and checks whether the return address belongs to a signed, known module. Unsigned callers get flagged.

Also performs static analysis on loaded modules: checks for missing security cookies, minimal import tables, absent `.pdata` sections, and other NoCRT indicators that suggest a purpose-built injection payload.

**What it detects:**
- CRT-linked unsigned DLLs via return address analysis
- NoCRT payloads via structural anomaly scoring
- Late-loaded modules that weren't part of the original process

**Stack:** C, Windows API, PE parsing
**Writeup:** [CRT vs NoCRT Detection](/2026/05/10/crt-nocrt-detection/)

### [VTCheck](https://github.com/Youssix/VTCheck) - Virtual Method Table Integrity Verifier

A runtime integrity checker for COM and C++ vtables. Validates that vtable pointers reference `.rdata` sections within their expected modules, and that individual function entries haven't been redirected outside the module boundary.

Performs RTTI chain validation on MSVC binaries by walking `CompleteObjectLocator` structures to verify class hierarchy integrity. Detects both direct vtable patching (modified entries in original `.rdata`) and full vtable replacement (object pointing to heap-allocated copy).

Built to monitor DXGI/D3D11 COM interfaces, which are frequent targets for both legitimate overlays and malicious hooks.

**What it detects:**
- Direct vtable entry patching
- Vtable pointer replacement (heap-allocated fake vtables)
- Broken or missing RTTI chains
- `.rdata` permission changes (VirtualProtect on read-only sections)

**Stack:** C++, COM, PE analysis, RTTI parsing
**Writeup:** [VMT Hooking Detection](/2026/05/12/vmt-hooking-detection/)

### [PEBWatch](https://github.com/Youssix/PEBWatch) - Process Environment Block Tamper Detection

A lightweight monitoring agent that periodically snapshots PEB state and cross-references it against kernel-side ground truth to detect manipulation.

Compares the PEB module list against the VAD tree and ETW module load history to find unlinked modules. Checks `ImagePathName`, `CommandLine`, `BeingDebugged`, and `NtGlobalFlag` for signs of post-creation tampering. Also monitors heap flags for anti-debug environment detection.

**What it detects:**
- Module unlinking (DLLs hidden from PEB but still loaded)
- ImagePathName spoofing
- CommandLine modification post-creation
- Anti-debug PEB field clearing
- Heap flag manipulation

**Stack:** C, Windows internals, ETW
**Writeup:** [PEB Internals](/2026/05/15/peb-windows-internals/)

### [IDAVtableRecovery](https://github.com/Youssix/IDAVtableRecovery) - IDA Pro Plugin for C++ Structure Reconstruction

An IDA Pro Python plugin that automates vtable discovery and C++ class hierarchy reconstruction from stripped binaries.

Walks `.rdata` sections looking for vtable signatures, parses RTTI structures when available, and reconstructs class inheritance trees. For binaries compiled without RTTI (`/GR-`), uses heuristic matching on vtable layouts and cross-references to infer relationships.

Exports recovered structures as IDA type definitions and generates annotated call graphs showing virtual dispatch relationships.

**What it does:**
- Automated vtable discovery from `.rdata` scanning
- RTTI-based class hierarchy reconstruction
- Heuristic vtable matching for stripped binaries
- Structure export to IDA type library
- Cross-reference mapping for virtual dispatch

**Stack:** Python, IDAPython, PE format, MSVC ABI
